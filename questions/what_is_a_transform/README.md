# What Is a Transform?

[![YouTube thumbnail](youtube_thumbnail.png?raw=true)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC-DrNbe5fA)


When you‚Äôre a newcomer to data engineering, data transformations are yet another concept for you to learn. We‚Äôll go through the main concepts using a relatable use case and provide Python examples for how you can apply them using a batch approach with the popular Pandas DataFrame library. Then we‚Äôll take that same code and show you how to modify it to use Streaming DataFrames, bringing it into the world of Kafka and stream processing with [Quix Streams](https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams).

We‚Äôll cover value transformations, schema transformations and stateless/stateful transformations.
